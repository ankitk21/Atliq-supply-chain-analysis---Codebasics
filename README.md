This was a Challenge put up by Codebasics and datasets was provides in excel format.

**Problem: AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend the annual contract due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.**
**The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’ and OnTime in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.** 


***Used SQL to create master table containing important metrics needed for this analysis***
***Created a dashboard in Power BI which showed the overall insights and also give us enough insights to help solve the supply chain problem.**![ATLIQ DASHBOARD-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108228299/205311382-0e02e755-eb91-4d2c-abb2-e6fe57493f94.png)***
